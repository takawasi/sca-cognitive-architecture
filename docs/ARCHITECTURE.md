# 🏗️ SCA System Architecture

## Overview

SCA (Symbiotic Cognitive Architecture) implements a hierarchical cognitive framework designed for optimal human-AI collaboration.

## Core Components

### 1. Context Mapper Server
- **Purpose**: System-wide context analysis and relationship mapping
- **Input**: Raw queries and requirements
- **Output**: Mermaid diagrams and structural analysis

### 2. Decomposition Server  
- **Purpose**: Complex problem breakdown into actionable tasks
- **Input**: Analyzed context and requirements
- **Output**: Prioritized task hierarchy with dependencies

### 3. Synthesis Server
- **Purpose**: Dialectical integration of multiple perspectives
- **Input**: Multiple information sources and viewpoints
- **Output**: Synthesized solutions with confidence ratings

### 4. Memory System
- **Purpose**: Persistent learning and knowledge accumulation
- **Features**: TSL compression, semantic search, pattern recognition
- **Storage**: Hierarchical memory with automatic archiving
