## 🎯 Overview

**SCA (Symbiotic Cognitive Architecture)** is a revolutionary framework that enables true collaboration between human intelligence and AI systems through structured thinking processes, persistent memory, and dialectical integration.

### Key Features

- **🧠 Systematic Thinking**: 4-stage mandatory cognitive process (Context → Decomposition → Synthesis)
- **💾 Persistent Memory**: MAL-compliant continuous learning system
- **⚖️ Dialectical Integration**: Multi-perspective synthesis for superior solutions
- **🤝 Collaborative Decision Making**: Human-AI partnership with clear responsibility
- **🔧 MCP Integration**: Built on Model Context Protocol standards
